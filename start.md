# Start with a development build

Development builds of your app are Debug builds of your project that has the `expo-dev-client` library installed in your project's dependencies.

To learn more, see [Create a development build using EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

Alternatively, you can also learn how to [compile your project locally with Android Studio or Xcode](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation).

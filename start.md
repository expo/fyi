# Start with a development build

[Development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) of your app are debug builds of a project with the `expo-dev-client` library.

See [Create a development build using EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) to learn how to build in the cloud, or learn [how to compile your project locally with Android Studio or Xcode](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation).

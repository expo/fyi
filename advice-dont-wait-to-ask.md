# Don't wait to ask[^1]

You may have been sent this document because **you waited to ask** a question,
such as:

> You: Hi<br/>
> You: Anyone got a second?<br/>
> You: Quick question.<br/>
> You: `@someone`?

In asynchronous messaging, this is similar to calling someone, then putting them on hold
after they pick up. If you prompt someont to respond before asking your question, you won't
get an answer sooner but are instead asking for someone's attention.

> **tl;dr:** don't wait to ask your question or wait for someone to respond, but rather
> write your question immediately.

This causes conflict and problems because:
- no one may respond, since they can't prioritize your message
- someone may respond while you won't be there to ask your question
- someone is prompted to give you their full attention to wait for your question

Maybe you tried to be polite and wanted to ease someone into your question or introduce
yourself before jumping into a request or asking for someone to commit to helping you - like
one would in person or on the phone? That's great!
But, online chats and forums are different.

Instead of letting someone respond in their own time, you're making them acknowledge your
message before then making them wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost time for
both you and the person responding (and that's frustrating for everyone).

**Instead, just ask your question.**

If you ask a question rather than asking for attention first, it's much more likely for someone
to see your question or problem, and leave a quick reply. In chats, since messages can be read
at any time and don't require someone's immediate attention, this makes sure chats stay asynchronous.

**If you feel it's rude to simply ask a question, combine your question with an introduction.**

> You: Hiya! `<question>`<br/>
> You: Hi everyone, I'm `<name>`. `<question>`

If you ask a question immediately, there's nothing stopping you from combining it with the introduction
you originally wanted to write first - like a letter. This not only gives you time to formulate and
write about your question or issue before others see it, it also allows you to introduce yourself.

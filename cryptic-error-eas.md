# Cryptic Error

Sometimes you'll receive an error that is cryptic and you won't know what to do.

## The error is informative but I don't know how to fix it

If it isn't covered in our (docs)[https://docs.expo.dev], then you should post about it in our forums.

## The error isn't informative

It could be a bug, or we need to show you a better error. Please obtain a stack trace by running `DEBUG=* eas <your-original-command>`. After that, create a (Github issue)[https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/issues]. Please include the following:

- Your stack trace
- Your cli version obtained with `eas --version`
- Any information or steps that would be helpful for someone to reproduce your issue on their machine.

# Cryptic Error

Sometimes you'll receive an error that is cryptic and you won't know what to do.

## The error is informative but I don't know how to fix it

If it isn't covered in our [docs](https://docs.expo.dev), then you should post about it in our [forums](https://chat.expo.dev/).

## The error isn't informative

It could be a bug, or we need to show you a better error. Please obtain a stack trace by running `DEBUG=* eas <your-original-command>`. After that, create a [Github issue](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/issues). Please include the following:

- Your stack trace
- Your cli version obtained with `eas --version`
- Any information or steps that would be helpful for someone to reproduce your issue on their machine.

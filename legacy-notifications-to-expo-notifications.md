## How to migrate from Expo's LegacyNotifications to the new `expo-notifications` library

If you're still using the `LegacyNotifications` library, it's time for you to migrate over! The new library brings plenty of new features, bug fixes, and is much more reliable and intuitive.

**If you're using Expo's push notification service, you don't need to change anything on the server-side for this migration.**

### Set up

Run `npx expo install expo-notifications`.

> If you're using the bare workflow, you'll need to follow [these additional instructions](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-notifications#installation-in-bare-react-native-projects).

Replace any occurrences of:

```
import { Notifications } from 'expo'
```

in your JS code with:

```
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
```

### Edit `app.json`

If you're upgrading to SDK 40 or below, you need to set `android.useNextNotificationsApi: true` in your app.json file. [See here for details](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#android).

Some values from [your `app.json` `notification` key](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#notification) still apply, but some do not:

- `icon` still applies, do not remove it âœ…
- `color` still applies, do not remove it âœ…
- `iosDisplayInForeground` does not apply, remove it ðŸš¨
  - With `expo-notifications`, this is controlled via [`Notifications.setNotificationHandler()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#setnotificationhandlerhandler-notificationhandler--null-void)
- `androidMode` does not apply, remove it ðŸš¨
- `androidCollapsedTitle` does not apply, remove it ðŸš¨
  - Both `androidMode` and `androidCollapsedTitle` will be replaced by setting a key in your notification payload, this feature is in progress.

### Replace function calls

Listed below are each of the methods exposed via the LegacyNotifications module, and what you should replace them with.

#### `LegacyNotifications.addListener()`

`addListener` allows you to provide a callback to be run whenever a notification is received or selected in your app. `expo-notifications` actually exposes two different methods to replace this: [`addNotificationReceivedListener()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#addnotificationreceivedlistenerlistener-event-notification--void-void) and [`addNotificationResponseReceivedListener()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#addnotificationresponsereceivedlistenerlistener-event-notificationresponse--void-void). The `NotificationReceivedListener` is triggered when a notification is received while your app is foregrounded. The `NotificationResponseReceivedListener` is triggered when a user **interacts** with a notification that was delivered to their device (either by tapping on it, or through the actions exposed via [notification categories](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#managing-notification-categories-interactive-notifications)).

Prefer to use hooks? `expo-notifications` has you covered- use the [`useLastNotificationResponseHook()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#uselastnotificationresponse-undefined--notificationresponse--null) instead of `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener`.

#### `LegacyNotifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()` & `LegacyNotifications.getDevicePushTokenAsync()`

Both `getExpoPushTokenAsync` and `getDevicePushTokenAsync` have the same methods in the new `expo-notifications` API:

- [`Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getexpopushtokenasyncoptions-expotokenoptions-expopushtoken)
- [`Notifications.getDevicePushTokenAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getdevicepushtokenasync-devicepushtoken)

The only difference is that the new methods return an object of the format `{ type: string, data: string }`, where `data` is the actual push token string. No other changes are necessary unless you eject to bare, in which case you should check the method parameters in the docs.

#### `LegacyNotifications.presentLocalNotificationAsync()` & `LegacyNotifications.scheduleLocalNotificationAsync()`

Both of these have been replaced by [`Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#schedulenotificationasyncnotificationrequest-notificationrequestinput-promisestring). To get the same behavior as `LegacyNotifications.presentLocalNotificationAsync` (AKA- trigger a notification instantly), just pass `null` in as the `NotificationTriggerInput`.

#### `LegacyNotifications.dismissNotificationAsync()`

There is an identical method in the new `expo-notifications` module- [`Notifications.dismissNotificationAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#dismissnotificationasyncidentifier-string-promisevoid)- no changes necessary.

#### `LegacyNotifications.dismissAllNotificationsAsync()`

There is an identical method in the new `expo-notifications` module- [`Notifications.dismissAllNotificationsAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#dismissallnotificationsasync-promisevoid)- no changes necessary.

#### `LegacyNotifications.cancelScheduledNotificationAsync()`

There is an identical method in the new `expo-notifications` module- [`Notifications.cancelScheduledNotificationAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#cancelschedulednotificationasyncidentifier-string-promisevoid)- no changes necessary.

#### `LegacyNotifications.cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()`

There is an identical method in the new `expo-notifications` module- [`Notifications.cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#cancelallschedulednotificationsasync-promisevoid)- no changes necessary.

#### `LegacyNotifications.getBadgeNumberAsync()`

Replace with [`Notifications.getBadgeCountAsync`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getbadgecountasync-promisenumber).

#### `LegacyNotifications.setBadgeNumberAsync()`

Replace with [`Notifications.setBadgeCountAsync`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#setbadgecountasyncbadgecount-number-options-setbadgecountoptions-promiseboolean).

### Notification Categories

Weâ€™ve added much more comprehensive support for categories in the new `expo-notifications` module, with plenty more customization options, so the methods and the parameters they accept are a little different. You should [read here](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#managing-notification-categories-interactive-notifications) for a complete guide.

> Replace `LegacyNotifications.createCategoryAsync` with `Notifications.setNotificationCategoryAsync`, and `LegacyNotifications.deleteCategoryAsync` with `Notifications.deleteNotificationCategoryAsync`.

### Android Notification Channels

Weâ€™ve added much more comprehensive support for Androidâ€™s notification channels in the new `expo-notifications` module, with plenty more customization options, so the methods and the parameters they accept are a little different. You should [read here](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#managing-notification-channels-android-specific) for a complete guide.

> Replace `LegacyNotifications.createChannelAndroidAsync` with `Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync`, and replace `LegacyNotifications.deleteChannelAndroidAsync` with `Notifications.deleteNotificationChannelAndroidAsync`.

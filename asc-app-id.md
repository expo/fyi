# App Store Connect app ID

A unique ID for every application existing in App Store Connect. It is typically a 10-digit number.

`ascAppId` can be configured per Submit Profile in [`eas.json` config](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/eas-json/#ios-specific-options).

### How do I find my App ID?

If your application is already on App Store Connect, please follow these steps:
1. Sign in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) and select your team
2. Navigate to the [Apps](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps) section if you're not already there
3. Click on your app name and ensure that _App Store_ tab is active at the top (next to your app's name)
4. On the left pane, under _General_ section, select _App Information_
5. Your App ID can be found under _General Information_ section, called `Apple ID`
   > Confusingly, _Apple ID_ in this context does not refer to your Apple account username, it refers to your App ID.

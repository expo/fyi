# Don't ask about solutions[^1]

You may have been sent this document because **you asked about solutions** to a problem,
rather than the problem itself, or without explaining your original problem.
This is called ["The XY Problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem)

> [!TIP]
> **tl;dr:** don't ask "Why is `<solution>` not working?", but rather ask:
> - "How do I solve `<problem>` given `<context>`?"
> - "I tried `<solution>` because of `<problem>` while working on `<context>`. What is an alternative solution?"
> - "I ran into `<issue>`, when trying to do `<context>`. What's happening and what's a possible solution?"

We often encounter problems that appear to have multiple, possible solutions. These
solutions themselves however could cause more problems, which in turn have multiple
solutions, which in turn may cause more problems...

What may have happened here is that you asked a question that mostly consists
of what you tried or what you're trying to do, rather than giving context on **why
it is you think you have to do this in the first place**. For example,

> You wanted to do `<X>`.<br/>
> You ran into a problem with `<X>` or don't know how to do `<X>`.<br/>
> You figured, you can solve `<X>` by doing `<Y>`.<br/>
> You ran into a problem with `<Y>` or don't know how to do `<Y>`.<br/>
> You asked for help with `<Y>`.<br/>
> Others help you with `<Y>` but are confused, because they don't know about `<X>`.

This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on your part, and
on the part of those trying to help you.

If you come to someone with a solution rather than the problem, you're denying them:
- the chance to evaluate if your solution may solve the problem
- the context on why this problem occurred and what you did
- reproduction steps that they may recognize

In the best case scenario, you may have mentioned your original problem, but spent
more time describing the solution. **Instead, explain how you ran into the problem,
and set your solution aside, so others have a chance to arrive at the same point
you did.**

In the worst case scenario, you may have completely omitted information on your
original problem, and you may have been sent this document because the issue you
posted above hints at another problem. **Instead, explain the context of what you
did before you started working on what you posted about.**

If you're not sure what to ask about, think back of when you started your task, and
explain:
> I started to work on `<task>` and wanted to achieve `<goal>`.
> Instead of `<expectation>`, I encountered `<problem>`.

If you talk about your original goals and problems rather than your later solutions,
you're telling others the full story of what happened and you may save yourself and
them some time having to hunt down where your problem originally started.

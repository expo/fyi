# Provisioning profile doesn't support the capability

Creating _Release_ iOS builds can fail if the provisioning profile is missing **capabilities**. Capabilities are enabled via the [Apple Developer Portal]()

Apple requires you register "capabilities" for an iOS app's bundle identifier via an Apple endpoint before you can create a production build of your app. Capabilities are related to the native iOS plist `*.entitlements` file in a project.

In Xcode, this can be done via the "Signing and Capabilities" tab, but because managed projects don't use Xcode we need some other way to register (otherwise the [production build will crash](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/pull/384)).

Tools like `eas-cli` are able to register capabilities with Apple, but only if the entitlements are defined statically i.e. not in a modifier. Because of this we recommend you modify the `ios.entitlements` object directly rather than through the `withEntitlements` mod.

## How to fix

Do one of the following:

### EAS Build

- Ensure you have the latest version of `eas-cli` installed.
- Ensure your entitlements are defined:
  - **Managed:** Run `npx expo config --type prebuild` and ensure the `ios.entitlements` has all of your capabilities defined.
  - **Bare:** Check that your `ios/*/*.entitlements` file has all of the desired entitlements defined. Alternatively you can open Xcode, go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and check there.
- Create a new iOS build with `eas build -p ios`
  - You should see a step **‚úî Synced capabilities** which will automatically sync the entitlements with Apple Dev Portal.

> If this doesn't work, please open an issue on [`expo/eas-cli`](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/issues).

### Xcode

> üí° Bare workflow, and Apple Mac users only

- Open the `ios` project in Xcode.
- Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
- Press "+ Capability" in the corner to select capabilities.
  - You can delete capabilities by pressing the "x" button in each capability's row.
  - Adding capabilities will cause Xcode to regenerate the provisioning profile.

### Apple Developer Portal

- Go to [Apple Dev Portal > Bundle Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
  - Or `developer.apple.com` > "Account" > "Certificates, IDs & Profiles" > "Identifiers"
- Find the "IDENTIFIER" matching your app's bundle identifier (defined in your `app.json` (`ios.bundleIdentifier`) or Xcode project).
- Add the missing capabilities (i.e. "Associated Domains") entitlement.
  - Press "Save"
  - Acknowledge the "Modify App Capabilities" (current provisioning profiles will be invalid).
- Rebuild your iOS app.

## Errors

<!-- Improves SEO -->

Here are some examples of what the Xcode build errors look like.

> üí° If you built with EAS Build, you can download the build logs and run `cat xcode-build.log | xcpretty` to make the results more readable.

### Associated Domains

The project has `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` in their `*.entitlements`, or `ios.associatedDomains` in their `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

```

# Don't ask to ask[^1]

You may have been sent this document because **you asked to ask** a question,
such as:

> You: Can someone message me about `<topic>`?
> You: Can anyone help me with `<topic>`?
> You: Does anyone know about `<topic>`?

This isn't particularly productive and doesn't often lead to others being able to
help you.

There are plenty of reasons why people who otherwise would help you, may not be able
to or may not commit to replying to you. If you ask to ask, you're omitting information
about your problem or question, since you haven't formalized it. You are instead asking
for something more broad and a large commitment from strangers.

Questions like the above cause conflict and problems because they:
- ask others to take responsibility to take the lead
- question people's confidence and knowledge
- wall out people who might be able to answer your question
- ask for someone's undivided attention in real time
- prompt people to commit to interviewing you to get to your real questions
- obscure any replies, which prevents it from being useful to other people

Others might see this as you not having done the work to diagnose your problem - and
conclude, why should they now put in any work to help you solve it.

**Instead, take the time to form a question please.**

The solution to the problem is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone may see your question,
and if they have an idea or recognize the problem, chances are they'll reply.

**If you're not sure what to ask, describe your issue.**

> Can someone help me with `<topic>`? I'm seeing `<problem>`, I've tried `<solution>`,
> but instead of `<expected>`, I get `<symptom>`.

Instead of leaving a message that only asks about a subject or topic, try describing your
issue, even if you don't know what question to ask. If people recognize your problem or
are interested in it, they are much more likely to help you, than if you had asked to ask.

### tl;dr

To summarize, don't ask "Does anyone know about `<topic>`?", but rather ask:
- "How do I solve `<problem>` given `<context>`?"
- "Why is `<problem>` occurring when I do `<action>`?"
- "What do I do when I see `<issue>`, after I've done `<context>`?"
